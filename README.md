Description  
===================================================================    
An open-source tool for flashing LPC microcontrollers. Currently  
tested on Ubuntu 20.04 (64-bit) with Qt 5.15 on LPC1343 and LPC1347.  
Should also work on LPC1315, LPC1316, LPC1317, LPC1345, LPC1346  
because they use the same bootloader, but it is not tested!  
If you tried any of these, contact me on lbogdanov@tu-sofia.bg  
for feedback.  
  
This program is free and can be used for open and closed source  
projects. I'd be happy if you tell me for what you are using it,  
so contact me on lbogdanov@tu-sofia.bg  

Example usage
===================================================================
The project can be built with Qt Creator. Just import it and press  
build. Then run the application and use the GUI to download or
upload firmware to/from the target.  
Put your microcontroller in UART boot mode. Connect a USB/UART  
converter to the respective pins of the microcontroller.
